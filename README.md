What is Clippy?
Clippy is a simple desktop application that renders chemical structures using different formats as input.
The key thing is that the app reads the input directly from your clipboard (hence the name clippy) rather than a file.
Once you have a rendered structure, you can export it in different formats (via the clipboard again).

Why should one prefer it to, let's say, MarvinView?
Apart from being Open Source and fully configurable, Clippy has some features currently missing from MarvinView, such as the ChEMBL ID, name and InChIKey look-ups. 
Furthermore, the clipboard interface makes Clippy really convenient when one just wants to quickly check a structure. 

Here's a list of input formats that are read from clipboard and rendered in Clippy:
ChEMBL IDs (via ChEMBL look-up)
SMILES (via RDKit)
InChI Strings (via RDKit)
InChI Keys (via ChEMBL look-up)
Nomenclature (via OPSIN)
Images (via OSRA)

Technical notes and dependencies 
Clippy uses web services calls mainly to Micha≈Ç Nowotka's Beaker server.
The application was written in Python and is natively cross-platform.
It is also packaged for Mac OS. As a result, the packaged version doesn't have any other dependencies whatsoever (apart from Beaker and an Apple machine).
